# Track-and-maintaining-details
The Karriers is a start-up in the logistics marketplace in the City. They are evolving to integrate the logistics network to provide transparent prices, extensive pincode coverage and powerful technology to track and manage shipments. The Company wished to expand its service boundary and decided to deploy Containers for their freight transport which would help them shorten shipping time and reduces losses from damage and theft. Containers were purchased immediately and ready for use while the Company wanted its Shipping Management System to be improved a bit more to manage, track and maintain the Container related information as well.
